# Computer Vision:

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos.

# How a computer sees an image?

A computer sees an image as 0's and 1's. Pixels is the smallest unit in an image. A digital image is a 2D array of pixels. Each pixel is charachterised by it (x, y) coordinares and its value.

When we take a digital image, it is stored as a combination of pixels. Each pixel has different number of channels. If its a grayscale image, it has only one image, it contains three channels : Red, Green, Blue (RGB)
